# cifar10-image-classification

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 categories. The model is trained to recognize these categories and can be tested using manually uploaded images.

## Features
- Automatic dataset loading and preprocessing using TensorFlow
- CNN model architecture for image classification
- Training and evaluation of model performance
- Manual image upload functionality for real-time predictions
- Image display and prediction results visualization

## Contributor
